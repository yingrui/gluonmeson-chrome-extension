If it doesn't work, please refresh the webpage or reload the extension.


The floating ball is implemented in content script, and it can open side panel by sending a message to the background service worker. The code is like this:
```typescript
// in content script
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: "open_side_panel" });

// in background service worker
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender) => {
  (async () => {
    if (message.type === "open_side_panel") {
      await chrome.sidePanel.open({ tabId: sender.tab.id });
    }
  })();
});
```

### 2.2. Shortcut Key

You can type `alt + enter` to open the side panel. If it doesn't work, please refresh the webpage or reload the extension.

This is also implemented in content script, and it can open side panel by sending a message to the background service worker:
```typescript
document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  if (event.altKey && event.key === "Enter") {
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: "open_side_panel" });
  }
});
```

### 2.3. Click the Toolbar to Open Side Panel

## 3. Context Menus

When you right-click the mouse in an `editable` text area, the context menu will show up. If you click the action item, then the command will be executed in sidepanel.

<img src="../images/generate_text_action_item_in_context_menu.png"/>

Currently, it only supports the `Generate Text` action. But you can add more context menu by yourself, for example:

* When you're read an article, and you don't understand something, then you can selected the text in the webpage, you can click the `explain` context menu. Which is a new functionality you can contribute.

## 4. Content Scripts

Some actions need to get more details information from the webpage, or need to execute some actions automatically in the webpage. So we need use the content scripts to achieve this, and it could be extended in the future.

For example, there is the `get_content` message, and this extension can send this message to get the webpage content and then generate a summary or ask questions.

This is an example of content script, which can help us to get the content of the webpage:

```typescript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  (async () => {
    if (message.type === "get_content") {
      sendResponse({
        title: document.title,
        text: document.body.innerText,
        url: document.URL,
      });
    }
  })();
